# Example2

One can use colors, as in the examples
below.

This is a @class[blue test;], but
if something should go wrong, you 
will receive a @class[red warning;].

The color @class[green green;] is also available.

To make these colors, or any other class
element operational, make a CSS definition 
of the class in `./public/assets/style.css`.
